# Repositories


*Repositories* on GitHub correspond to *tracked working directories* on your computer.

# Cloning

*Cloning* downloads a repository from the cloud (GitHub) to your local computer, and links your local copy to the cloud.

# Commits


::: {layout-ncol="2"}

When you make changes to a repository, *committing* your changes saves a snapshot in the version history.

# Commits

::: {layout-ncol="2"}


*Commit messages* record notes on what changes with each update.

![](images/commits.png){fig-alt="A data directory with many similar filenames like \"Final_FINAL.R\""}
:::

# Push and pull

*Pushing* and *pulling* synchronize changes made on your local computer with changes in the cloud, and vice versa.

# Branching
::: {layout-ncol="2"}

*Branches* allow you to make changes to a repository without modifying the primary source code.

![](images/branch1.png){fig-alt="A page with branches in GitHub"}
:::

# Forks

::: {layout-ncol="2"}


*Forks* are similar to branches, but copy a whole repository to your personal GitHub account. 

![](images/fork.png){fig-alt="A forked repository in GitHub"}

:::

# Pull request

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

When you finish making changes in a branch or fork, opening a *pull request* allows collaborators to review your changes and add them to the primary version.
