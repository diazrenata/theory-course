*Repositories* on GitHub correspond to *tracked working directories* on your computer.

# Cloning

*Cloning* downloads a repository from the cloud (GitHub) to your local computer, and links your local copy to the cloud.

# Commits

![](commits.png){fig-alt="A data directory with many similar filenames like \"Final_FINAL.R\""}

When you make changes to a repository, *committing* your changes saves a snapshot in the version history.

# Commits

*Commit messages* record notes on what changes with each update.

# Push and pull

![](push_pull.png){fig-alt="The push and pull buttons in RStudio"}

*Pushing* and *pulling* synchronize changes made on your local computer with changes in the cloud, and vice versa.
